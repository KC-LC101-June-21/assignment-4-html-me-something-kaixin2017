            <h2>Birth</h2>
            <p>
               On June 15th, 2017, you were born, 5 days earlier than your due date. You were named Kai(open in Chinese) Xin(heart in Chinese) because Mommy and Daddy hope you remember openning your heart and being happy. Daddy said you were his father's day gift.
               Your 'A Gong' and 'A Po' came from China about 15 days earlier to wait for your birth, 
               they were just as excited as Mom and Dad to see you on your first day in this world.

            <p>
               On June 15th, 2020, you were 3. For this very different Birthday, we were celebrating in China with'A Gong' and 'A Po'. We came to visit them on Juanury 13th, right after when a bug called COVID-19 was found out dangerous and could make you feel really sick. Due to COVID19, our plane planned at March 1st 2020 was canceled by the company and we came back to Daddy on July 18th, 2020. Mommy thought you were travel hero. At age of 3 you traveled across US and China for 2 times and did really well during trips, so mommy ordered you a spiderman cake.  Since then spiderman became your best friend!
